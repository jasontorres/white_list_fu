WhiteListFu
===========

An ActiveRecord before_validation hook that makes sure data saved is white listed using the WhiteList plugin that can be found at http://svn.techno-weenie.net/projects/plugins/white_list/. That means you do your filtering inside the model instead of doing everything on the views.

This makes your model data XSS safe, which it should be.

Syntax:

by default it white_list all your string and text fields, but in case that you don't want to,  just use the  :except option.

class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  white_listed :except => [:name, :body]
end
